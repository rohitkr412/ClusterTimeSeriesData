/**
 * Interpolation is the process of constructing a function that takes on
 * specified values at specified points. In engineering and science, one often
 * has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation, which
 * represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the
 * independent variable. It is often required to interpolate (i.e. estimate)
 * the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent
 * variable. A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is
 * the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function.

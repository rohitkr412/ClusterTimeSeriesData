/**
 * Statistical hypothesis tests. A statistical hypothesis test is a method
 * of making decisions using data, whether from a controlled experiment or
 * an observational study (not controlled). In statistics, a result is called
 * statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone,
 * according to a pre-determined threshold probability, the significance level.
 * <p>
 * Hypothesis testing is sometimes called confirmatory data analysis, in
 * contrast to exploratory data analysis. In frequency probability, these
 * decisions are almost always made using null-hypothesis tests (i.e., tests
 * that answer the question Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, what
 * is the probability of observing a value for the test statistic that is at
 * least as extreme as the value that was actually observed?) One use of
 * hypothesis testing is deciding whether experimental results contain enough
 * information to cast doubt on conventional wisdom.
 * <p>
 * A result that was found to be statistically significant is also called a
 * positive result; conversely, a result that is not unlikely under the null
 * hypothesis is called a negative result or a null result.
 * <p>
 * Statistical hypothesis testing is a key technique of frequentist statistical
 * inference. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing is to base rejection
 * of the hypothesis on the posterior probability. Other approaches to reaching
 * a decision based on data are available via decision theory and optimal
 * decisions.
